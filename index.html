  <h3>MISTAKES DURING MY PREPARATION</h3>
  <p>
  <UL>
    <LI><em><strong>No Consistency..</strong></em></LI>
  </UL>
  One of the biggest mistake that i had made during preparation was that i was not consistent enough. I studied 14-16 hours one day and didn't studied for next 2-3 days.
  There was time where i was able to solve even toughest of the problems of maths but due to inconsistency in my study routine i wasn't able to pull all that off.
  <ul>
    <li>
      <em><strong>No Friends/Loneliness</strong></em>
    </li>
  </ul>
  Being introvert from the beginning i didn't have much friends, but in pandemic i lost even those 1 or 2 idiots that i had :(.... I was not good in socialising with the people, afraid to talk to new people, SO in 12th and drop year I was all alone.
  I am not close to mama and papa, so didn't even tell them what I am going through :)
  <UL>
    <LI>
      <EM><STRONG>Gaming Addiction</STRONG></EM>
    </LI>
  </UL>
  Since i felt loneliness...i decided to make virtual and online friends so that i can talk with people without revealing my identity. I played CSGO, VALORANT, APEX LEGEND.
  TBH soon that urge to find new people and friends turned into addiction which costs 1 entire year
  <ul>
    <li>
      <em><strong>Masturbation</strong></em>
    </li>
  </ul>
  TBH it was not an addiction but it has bad impact on health so its a bad habit. I masturbated twice or may be thrice a month. but one should not make it an Addiction
  <ul>
    <li>
      <em><strong>Depression</strong></em>
    </li>
  </ul>
  At the end of result I am very much depressed right now. I have done countless mistakes. Few days back i was having a suicidal thoughts.<br />But I know i have my mom dad who
  loves me more than i could imagine...may be i am not that open but i think i love them too.<br />
  ALSO I AM STRONG..I KNOW THAT...ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š <img src="nnaanna.png" align="right" />

    <em>although one thing i dont regret is watching anime. It changed the way of my thinking and i personally feel connected to it.</em>
